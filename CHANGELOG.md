## [4.1.0] - 2016-07-01

##### Changed
- Cleaned up deliverable files for Sass and CSS boilerplate packages to correspond to "Getting Started" documentation on Evolution site.
- Application level icon font files were renamed to correspond to "app" versus "site" naming:
	- assets/fonts/evo-icon-font-site.* renamed to assets/fonts/evo-icon-font-app.*
	- Sass variables and icon class names updated

##### Fixed
- Fixed package.json to be "shrink wrapped" so NPM dependency versions are locked in for each release. This will make sure newer NPM dependencies are not downloaded on Tool Box install.
- Fixed the application level icomoon font files to be blank by default and not contain the whole icomoon library.
